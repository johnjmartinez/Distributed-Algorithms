###ABSTRACT
Using proven algorithms for distributed networking and open source mobile client studio design kits, it is possible to quickly, efficiently and inexpensively create and maintain a fully extensible restaurant system that keeps total ordering of patron requests. The benefits of such system will be apparent in the resulting and significant savings in time, resource and money budgeting, and strategizing for specific target groups.
